👋 Hello.  

📛 My name is Shane Doucette.  

📍 I live in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.  

💻 Professionally, I am an IT Specialist<!--at a not so little company called [7shifts](https://7shifts.com)-->.

      📖 read  
      🚴‍♀️ ride my bike for exercise and fun  
      📷 practice photography  
      ▶️ play...  
            🎲 table-top games

🏄‍♀️ I've been hanging around on the Internet long enough that I think Internet should be capitalised. I think I'll settle here for a spell.
