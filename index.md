# The web home of Shane Doucette

👋 Hello.  

📛 My name is Shane Doucette.  

📍 I live in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.  

💻 Professionally, I am an IT Specialist at a little company called [zu](https://zu.com).  

🧔🏻‍♂️ Personally, I like to...  
- 📖 read  
- ▶️ play...  
  - 🎲 table-top games  
  - 🗡 role playing games  
  - 🎮 video games  
- 👨‍🍳 cook...  
  - 🍳 breakfast (my omelettes are delicious)  
  - 🥪 sandwiches  
  - 🍔 🍝 🍗 🥞 🌮 really, anything fun and yummy  
- 🚴‍♀️ ride my bike for exercise and fun  
- 📷 practice photography  

🏄‍♀️ I've been hanging around on the Internet long enough that I think Internet should be capitalised. I think I'll settle here for a spell.  

📧 If you'd like to talk with me, you can reach me at shane «at» doucette «dot» org.
