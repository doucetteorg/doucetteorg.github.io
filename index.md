👋 Hello.  

📛 My name is Shane Doucette (he/him).

📍 I live in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.  

💻 Professionally, I am an IT Specialist at a not so little company called [7shifts](https://7shifts.com). There, with my fellow IT Specialists, I do things like...  
      💻 Administer our fleet of Mac computers with JAMF  
      💾 Manage a wide variety of software and services  
      🌐 Oversee our network infrastructure  
      👨🏻‍💻 Write scripts and other code to facilitate all of this and more  
      And most importantly...  
      🙋‍♀️ Empower people to work at their best with the computing tools at their disposal  
      
🧔🏻 Personally, I like to...  
      📖 read  
      🚴‍♀️ ride my bike for exercise and fun  
      📷 practice photography  
      ▶️ play...  
            🎲 table-top games  
            🗡 role playing games  
            🎮 video games  
      🥘 cook...  
            🍳 breakfast (my omelettes are delicious)  
            🥪 sandwiches  
            🍔 🍝 🍗 🥞 🌮 really, anything fun and yummy  

🏄‍♀️ I've been hanging around on the Internet long enough that I think Internet should be capitalised. I think I'll settle here for a spell.

🤓 In fact, here's my Geek Code Block:
